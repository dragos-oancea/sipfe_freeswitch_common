The FreeSWITCH daemon should be launched with -nonat option.

The configuration defines two Sofia profiles: "inside" and
"outside". Both profiles disallow registration and transfers, and the
inside profile allows unauthenticated calls from internal network
only. The outside profile is used for communicating with ITSP trunks.

FreeSWITCH is built with the following command:

./configure \
  --with-openssl \
  --enable-zrtp \
  --bindir=/opt/sipfe/sbin \
  --prefix=/opt/sipfe/freeswitch \
  --localstatedir=/var \
  --sysconfdir=/opt/sipfe/etc/freeswitch \
  --with-rundir=/var/run/freeswitch

The configuration consists of two parts: the common part is generic for
similar designs, and is published on github. The private part contains
all information specific to the site, including ITSP authentication
credentials.

The common part is located in "/opt/sipfe/etc/freeswitch". The file
"site_vars.xml" is ignoired by Git and is dedicated for redefining the
global variables that are declared in "vars.xml". At least the binding
IP addresses and internal ACL needs to be defined in "site_vars.xml".


The private part consists of the following files and directores:

/opt/sipfe/etc/freeswitch/site_vars.xml
 This file redefines global variables that are defined in "vars.xml".

/opt/sipfe/etc/freeswitch_siteconfig/freeswitch_siteconfig.xml
 This file can add global definitions if needed.

/opt/sipfe/etc/freeswitch_siteconfig/sip_outside_gateways/*.xml
 The outside Sofia gateways for ITSP authentication are defined here.
